## Week 3: Procrastination and Memory 
---
+ **Habit is energy saver.** It allows us to free our mind for other types of activities.
+ Habits have 4 parts:
	- The **cue**: Trigger that launches you in zombie mode.
	The cues are of four types: 
		- *Location*
		- *Time*
		- *How you feel*
		- *Reactions*
	- The **routine**: Routine habitual response brain falls into when it      receives the cue.
	- The **reward**: Habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings. 
	- The **belief**: Habits have power because you have belief in them.

A good habit can be instilled by rewarding after every good habit is performed.

### Focus on process, not product  
+ It's fine if you have negative feelings before starting to learning. It's **how you react**. 
Eg: if you have homework. Focus on doing it for 30 mins than doing the entire homework. 
This is why Pomodoros work.
+ If distractions arises, **let it flow** by.
+ **Minimize** distractions if possible.

### Harnessing power of habits to minimize use of willpower  
+ Don't full scale change of old habits. Just **override parts** of them and develop new ones.
+ **Change your reaction** to the cue. This is the only place you need your willpower.
+ **Have a plan** to avoid the reaction when cue occurs.
	- Plan may not work perfectly, but **keep at it.**
	- **Adjust** if need be.
	- **Celebrate** when the plan works.
+ See if you can **replace** some other reward instead of the small time pleasure you get while procrastinating. Like an internal bet, a green tea cup later? **Reward yourself** even bigger after finishing the full task.
+ If you want to overcome your previous cravings, replace them with new ones.
+ **Setting a reward at a specific time,** like breaking off for lunch with a friend, or stopping the main tasks at 5PM gives a mini deadline that can spur the work.
+ It takes few pomodoros of drudgery to get into a flow state.
+ The **better** you are at something, **more enjoyable** it becomes.
+ Have the belief that you can do it. **Believe that your new system works.**

### Juggling life and learning
+ Mixing different types of activities make your learning enjoyable. For eg: Chores and studying.
+ **Plan a quitting time**. Eg: 5PM
+ Those who are committed to **maintaining healthy leisure time** along with their hard work outperform those who doggedly pursue an endless treadmill.
+ **Eat your frogs first** thing in the morning.

### Key aspects to tackle procrastination
+ Keep a planner journal. You can track when you reach your goals and observe what works and what doesn't.
+ Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day.
+ Write your todos the night before.
+ Arrange your work in series of small challenges. Ensure there are rewards for each of the challenges.
+ **Gain trust in your new system**. So you don't feel guilty when you are resting.

### Diving deeper into memory
+ It's easier to remember a concept by an image. Try making it absurd, funny.
+ To begin tapping into your visual memory system try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember.
+ Flashcards are helpful. 
+ Handwriting > typing

### Creating Meaningful groups and the memory palace technique
+ Place the items in a list you want to remember on a place you know well.
For eg: Grocery list spread across your living room.
+ Memory tricks allow to use working memory with easy access to long term memory.
