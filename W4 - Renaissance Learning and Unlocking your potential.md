## Week 4: Renaissance Learning and Unlocking your potential
---

When you go through a homework or test questions and don’t go back to check your work, you’re acting like a person who’s refusing to use parts of his brain.

### Test Checklist

+ Did you make a serious effort to understand the text? If you had a study guide, did you go through it?
+ Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution?
+  Did you understand all your homework problems’ solutions? If not, did you ask for explanations?
+   Did you work with classmates on homework problems? checked your solutions?
+   Did you consult your instructor/teacher when you had a problem with something?
+   Did you sleep well the night before the test?
+ Did you participate actively in homework group discussions, contributing ideas and asking questions?

### Intelligence

+ Being smart usually equate to having a large working memory (more than just four slots).
+ However, a super working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts won’t easily find a way into the brain. Such a tightly controlled attention could use an occasional breath of ADHD. You attention shifts even if you don’t want it to shift.
+ **Deliberate practice** is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted. Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.
+ **Persevere, take responsibility for learning and changing your thoughts.**
+ **Right hemisphere** helps us put our work into the big picture perspective and does reality checks.
+ **Left hemisphere** interprets the world for us but with a tendency for rigidity, dogmatism and egocentricity. It may lead to overconfidence. **Ex:** believing dismissively that your answers are correct.

-   Always step back and recheck to takes advantages of abilities of both-hemispheres interactions.
-   Brainstorm and find focused people to analyze your work with.    
    -   Your errors are sometimes easier to be found by others.
    -   Explaining yourself to others helps you understand more.
    -   Studying in a team helps you catch what you missed, or what you can’t see.
-   **Don’t fool yourself.** Don’t blindly believe in your intellectual abilities. Having a team can bring those projections down.

**Hard Start - Jump to easy:** 

1.  **Take a quick look** at the test when it’s handed to you to get a sense of what it involves.
    
2.  **Start with the hardest problem.** Pull yourself out if you get stuck for over 2 minutes. _Starting with a hard problem loads your focused mode first and then switches attention away from it. This allows the diffused mode to start its work._
    
3.  **Turn next to an easy problem.** Solves what you can, then move back to a hard one. _This allows the different part of your brain to work simultaneously on different thoughts._

-   Being Stressed before a test is normal. The body puts ups out chemicals when it’s under stress. How you interpret the body reaction to those chemicals makes all the difference.  
    -   **Shift your thinking** from "I am afraid of this test" to “I am excited to do my best”.
+ **Relax your brain on the last day before a test.** Have a quick final look at the materials. Feeling guilty the last day is a natural reaction if you have prepared well.
