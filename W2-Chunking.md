# Week 2 : Chunking
---
**What are chunks?**
**Chunks** are compact packages of information  that mind can easily access. 
*Example*: You know passages of songs. Later you connect those chunks to sing the whole song.

You form chunks by listening, watching, **observing patterns** of what you are trying to learn. Forming chunks vary by the activity you are learning.

**Basic steps to form a chunk:** 
1. **Focus** your undivided attention on the information you want to chunk.
2. **Understand the basic idea** you're trying to chunk.
3. **Gain context** so you can see not just how but also when to use this chunk.
4. **Practice** to make those connections stronger.

 + Just understanding how a problem was solved (for example in worked out examples) doesn't necessarily create a chunk that you can easily call to mind later.
+ You need to also **understand the connection** between the steps, that is why a particular step was done after the previous one.
+ **Don't confuse** 'Aha!' of a breakthrough and understanding with solid expertise.
+ **Test yourself** frequently. You learn something when you can do it yourself.
+ Take a "picture walk" through the material to **gain big picture** context before diving into the details.

**Two ways to learning** that are both vital in gaining mastery of a material:
+ **Bottom-up learning:** practice and repetition helps build and strengthen chunks.
+ **Top down learning:** Allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in.

Context is where both bottom-up and top-down learning meet.
