# Week 2 : Chunking
---
<ins>**What are chunks?**</ins>
**Chunks** are compact packages of information  that mind can easily access. 
*Example*: You know passages of songs. Later you connect those chunks to sing the whole song.

You form chunks by listening, watching, **observing patterns** of what you are trying to learn. Forming chunks vary by the activity you are learning.

<ins>**Basic steps to form a chunk:** </ins>
1. **Focus** your undivided attention on the information you want to chunk.
2. **Understand the basic idea** you're trying to chunk.
3. **Gain context** so you can see not just how but also when to use this chunk.
4. **Practice** to make those connections stronger.

 + Just understanding how a problem was solved (for example in worked out examples) doesn't necessarily create a chunk that you can easily call to mind later.
+ You need to also **understand the connection** between the steps, that is why a particular step was done after the previous one.
+ **Don't confuse** 'Aha!' of a breakthrough and understanding with solid expertise.
+ **Test yourself** frequently. You learn something when you can do it yourself.
+ Take a "picture walk" through the material to **gain big picture** context before diving into the details.

<ins>**Two ways to learning**</ins> that are both vital in gaining mastery of a material:
+ **Bottom-up learning:** practice and repetition helps build and strengthen chunks.
+ **Top down learning:** Allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in.

Context is where both bottom-up and top-down learning meet.

### Illusions of competence
+ Instead of just re-reading the material, practice and recall (test) the material you learned. It's more effective than any other technique including concept mapping.
+ But testing yourself without studying the material first doesn't work well.
+ Re-reading is effective only when you re-read after some time so that it is **spaced repetition.**
+ Merely glancing at material and thinking you know the solution is illusion of competence. Glancing at the material doesn't make those neural connections for you. The **information must persist to gain mastery and get creative with it.**
+ Underlining and highlighting if not done very carefully understanding the basic idea can be ineffective and misleading (damn! I feel attacked. )
+ Words and **concepts in margin** that synthesize key ideas are good ideas.
+ **Testing yourself** is the best way to retain the concepts.
+ **Making mistakes** correct your thinking.
+ **Recalling in an environment other than your place of study** can also help in strengthen the grasp on the material.
Why? Because when you are learning something new you can often take subliminal cues from the room and the space around you at the time you were learning the material. This can throw you off in a test room which is a different location. By recalling and thinking about the material when you are in various physical environments, **you become independent** of the cues **from any one given location.**

### What Motivates You?

+ Learning becomes easier when you are interested in it.
+ There are three important neuromodulators:
	1. **Acetylcholine**
	2. **Serotonin**
	3. **Dopamine** 

<ins>**Acetylcholine**: </ins>
+ Affects ***focused learning*** and ***attention***. Leads to new long term memory.

<ins>**Serotonin**:</ins>
+ Affects your ***social life***. In monkey troops, alpha male has the highest level of serotonin activity, and the lowest ranking male has the lowest levels.
+  &#8595; Serotonin level  &#8593; Risk taking behavior
+ Emotions affect learning. It is intertwined with perception and attention and interact with learning and memory.

<ins>**Dopamine**:</ins>
+ Our motivation is controlled by a chemical substance called dopamine.
+  It is released when we receive an unexpected ***reward***.
+ It also predicts future rewards and not just the immediate reward.
+ ***Loss of dopamine*** neurons leads to a ***lack of motivation*** and something called Anhedonia, which is loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure.

### The Value of a Library of Chunks
+ Chunks can help you understand new concepts. When you grasp one chunk, that **chunk can be related** in surprising ways to similar chunks. Not only in that field but also in different fields.
+ It's important to have variety/**creativity** in learning. It helps build the network between the chunks and increases problem solving.

### Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, and Interleaving
+ Overlearning is good sometimes as it creates automaticity that can be helpful in situations like serving a tennis ball. But overlearning in a *single session* can a waste of valuable learning time.
+ Overlearning can give an **illusion of mastery** when you mastered only the easy concepts.
+ **Einstellung**: A known pattern may block from getting new ideas. You initial idea of how things need to be done is misleading. You need to unlearn your old erroneous older ideas.
+ **Mix** up your learning.
+ Repetition and practice strengthen the neural connections, **interleaving** **builds flexibility and creativity.**
+ Although practice and repetition are important in helping build solid neural patterns to draw on, it’s interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity. It’s where you leave the world of practice and repetition and begin thinking more independently.

### Interview with Dr. Norman Fortenberry - Executive director of the American Society of Engineering Education 

<ins>**Learning at MIT**</ins>

+ Be part of a team, not alone.
+ Don't jump directly into hard stuff. Take it step by step.
+ Take a break, turn your brain off at times.
+ Use **multi-mode learning inputs** - visual, auditory, teaching, discussing, etc

### Interview with Scott Young, a "Marco Polo" of Learning

+ Clubbed and learnt 4 year MIT course in one year.
+ Believes in diving into hard problems and getting that strain to learn.
+ Tests himself frequently.
+ **Teach yourself step by step**. When you realize you are getting vague, you know what to revise. Feynman's technique.
+ Don't fool yourself into thinking that you're learning.
+ Create vivid examples. Uses **analogies and metaphors.**
+ Always **have a plan**. Create a project out of it. It keeps you motivated.
+ Intensity/Focused time/**Quality > Quantity**
