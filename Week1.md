# Week 1: What is learning?
---

**Some facts about brain:**
  + Weighs 3 pounds but consumes ten times more energy by weight than rest of the body.
  + Thoughts, hopes, fears, everything is in the neurons of brain.
  + There are million billion ( :O ) synapses (which are junctions between two neurons) in the brain where information is stored.
  + New synapses are created on dendrites (consider them as one thread of information) after you learn AND sleep.
  + Synapses are less than a micron (one millionth of a metre) in diameter, where human hair's for the same is 20 microns. Basically, they are extremely tiny.

**There are two modes of thinking:**
  + **Focused mode**: Concentrate intently on something. Thoughts have similar patterns.
   + **Diffuse mode**: Relaxed thinking. Free to think different ways, out of the box, creative ideas. Gives you a big picture.

You can't be in both thinking modes at the same time. Make your mind *flow between them*.

Learning something new takes time. It takes **consistent** practice.

Metaphors and Analogies provide powerful techniques for learning.


When needing ideas, **Salvador Dali** (he was one crazy guy!) would go into a relax mode, sitting on his chair, thinking, with keys in his hands dangling above the floor. When the keys fell, the clank would wake him up and he would focus back on his ideas with more perspective this time because of the diffuse thinking. **Thomas Edison** did the same.
