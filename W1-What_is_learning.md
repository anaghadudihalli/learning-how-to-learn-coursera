# Week 1: What is learning?

**Some facts about brain:**
  + Weighs 3 pounds but consumes ten times more energy by weight than rest of the body.
  + Thoughts, hopes, fears, everything is in the neurons of brain.
  + There are million billion ( :O ) synapses (which are junctions between two neurons) in the brain where information is stored.
  + New synapses are created on dendrites (consider them as one thread of information) after you learn AND sleep.
  + Synapses are less than a micron (one millionth of a metre) in diameter, where human hair's for the same is 20 microns. Basically, they are extremely tiny.

**There are two modes of thinking:**
  + **Focused mode**: Concentrate intently on something. Thoughts have similar patterns.
   + **Diffuse mode**: Relaxed thinking. Free to think different ways, out of the box, creative ideas. Gives you a big picture.

You can't be in both thinking modes at the same time. Make your mind *flow between them*.

Learning something new takes time. It takes **consistent** practice.

Metaphors and Analogies provide powerful techniques for learning.

When needing ideas, **Salvador Dali** (he was one crazy guy!) would go into a relax mode, sitting on his chair, thinking, with keys in his hands dangling above the floor. When the keys fell, the clank would wake him up and he would focus back on his ideas with more perspective this time because of the diffuse thinking. **Thomas Edison** did the same.

**Problem**: When you don't want to do something, you activate areas associated with pain. Your brain tries to avoid the pain by switching your attention to something else.  This results in you feeling happy temporarily. This is **procrastination**.
But researchers found that not long after you start working on it, the neurodiscomfort disappears.

**Solution:** **Pomodoro Technique**
	1. Set a timer for 25 mins.
	2. Turn off all interruptions.
	3. Focus.
	4. Give yourself a little reward.
	5. Resume after the break (~5 mins)

### Practice makes permanent
It's important to practice with ideas and concepts you're learning to help enhance and strengthen the neural connection you make during the learning process.

The more abstract the topic is, the more you need to practice.

Take a break after some time of intense focus and learning. Diffuse mode solidifies the concept during breaks.

Let the 'cement dry' as opposed to cramming all at once.

Types of memory:

 + **Long term memory**: stores information for a long time
 + **Working memory**: deals with stuff you are immediately and consciously processing in your mind. Centered in prefrontal cortex.

Working memory can have only 4 chunks of information.

Long term memory is immense. You can store large amount of information. 
You need to repeat and revisit information to store it in long term memory.
It's where you store fundamental concepts of stuff you're learning about.

**Problem**: How to store in long term memory?
**Solution**: **Spaced Repetition**
This technique involves repeating what you're trying to learn. Space the repetition.

### Importance of sleep
Being awake causes toxic products in brain. Sleep washes away these toxins.

During sleep, brain erases the less important parts of memories and strengthens areas that you want to remember. It rehearses the tougher material.

Learning just before sleeping, or sleeping after you learn is very effective in retaining the knowledge.
Dreaming about what you learnt enhances your ability to understand.
